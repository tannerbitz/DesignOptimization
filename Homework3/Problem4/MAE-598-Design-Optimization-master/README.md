# MAE-598-Design-Optimization
## Young's Modulus Prediction
### Introduction
In this application, you will learn how to use Tensorflow backend Keras to predict Young's Modulus of Sandstone structures through a
Convolutional Neural Network(CNN).

### Get Ready
#### Jupyter Notebook
This code is written in Jupyter Notebook, which is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, please download and install it. For new users we highly recommend installing [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)(Python 3.6 version). 

After installing, launching the jupyter notebook by typing in ```anaconda prompt``` in the search field under start menu and then type in:
```
jupyter notebook
```
and find your target folder. Or you can 'cd' to your target folder in the terminal and then type ```jupyter notebook``` command.

Once it's done, please follow the following steps to run this code.
1. Install TensorFlow [CPU version](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/)
2. Download this repo
3. Once done, use the terminal to go to the folder where you hold this code, type in

```
pip install -r requirement.txt
```
##### if it's not successful, you may try install the dependancies mannually by:
1. Run a terminal(type in ```cmd``` in the search field under start menu)
2. type in ``` pip install matplotlib ``` Enter
3. type in ``` pip install keras ``` Enter
4. type in ``` pip install sklearn ``` Enter

This should install all dependancies.
